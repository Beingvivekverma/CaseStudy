
Logic Explanation for Scenario 1: Sending Surveys to Customers

1. Created metadata in the org :

	i. Custom Fields on Contact standard object : 
		Language__c : required Picklist with values : de, en
		Survey_Date__c : storing Data value, non-required in nature. 
		Is_German__c : Formula(Checkbox) : This is a boolean field deriving its value based on Language__c field.
						If the Language__c is de -> this field is TRUE, else FALSE. This field is created to control the text of EmailTemplate.
						Has described its function in detail under EmailTemplate.
						
	ii. EmailTemplate creation : Created a EmailTemplate named 'Send Survey'. Contact record's ID is passed to this template from Batch(during MassEmail send).
								We are utilizing the boolean field Is_German__c to set the body of Email(English/ German). 
								Please check the metadata of template attached.
								
	iii. ApexClass : 
			N26_SendSurveyEmailsToCustomers : Batch class processing all the Contact records which have Survey_Date__c value as NON-NULL. 
											There is not point in picking Contact records having null value for Survey_Date__c field as we will send Emails
											based on this Survey_Date__c value.
										Batch is implementing Database.Stateful interface to maintain state of some variables(between different batches).
										Some variables like : thisBatchsContactsToBeProcessedSize & contactsToUpdate have been kept local to maintain their scope only during the current batch.
										Once EmailSend result is successful, we have used these variables to pick only those Contacts for which Email send was successful.
										Under Catch block, we can log the Exception(s) into a custom object for re-try mechanism. 
	
			N26_SendSurveyEmailsToCustomers_Test : This is the test class for N26_SendSurveyEmailsToCustomers. Have 2 test methods:
							test_EmailSendCase : Tests the actual Email sending scenario 
							test_EmailSendExceptionCase : Tests the scenario where we will exceed our MassEmail sending Limit(basically the Exception case)
							createContacts : Method for creating Test data.
							
			N26_SendSurveyEmailsToCustomersSchedule : Schedule class for the Batch. 

			N26_SendSrveEmailsToCstmrsScheduleTest : Test for the Schedule class.
		
	Please let me know if you have any doubt(s)/feedback in understanding the Logic. I will be very glad to have a discussion. 
	
	Thanks,
